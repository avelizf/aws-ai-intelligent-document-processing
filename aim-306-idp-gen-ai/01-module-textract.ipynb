    "Amazon Textract [analyzes documents and forms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-analyzing.html) for relationships among detected text. Amazon Textract analysis operations return 6 categories of document extraction as listed below, each of these categories are known as _features_ of Amazon Textract document analysis. Document analysis with Amazon Textract is available via the [`AnalyzeDocument`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_AnalyzeDocument.html) synchronous API, and the [`StartDocumentAnalysis`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_StartDocumentAnalysis.html) asynchronous API. \n",

    "  \n",
    "- **`FORMS`**: Form data returned with KEY / VALUE pairs for forms documents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`TABLES`**: Amazon Textract can extract tables, table cells, the items within table cells, table titles and footers, and the type of table. Amazon Textract can also be programmed to return the results in a JSON, CSV, or TXT file. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`QUERIES`**: When processing a document with Amazon Textract, you may add queries to your analysis to specify what information you need. This involves passing a question, such as \"What is the customer's social security number?\" to Amazon Textract. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`SIGNATURES`**: Amazon Textract can detect the locations of signatures in text documents. These are returned as geometry objects with bounding boxes that provide the location of a signature on the page, alongside the confidence that a signature is in that location.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`LAYOUT`**: Layout is a new feature that enables you to automatically extract layout elements such as paragraphs, titles, and more from documents. Layout builds on Textractâ€™s word and line detection by automatically grouping the text into these layout elements and ordering the text and elements as a human would read (i.e., left to right, top to bottom). Layout is helpful when it comes to processing the extracted text with Large Language Models (LLM), since it is capable of allowing you to preserve the layout and reading order of the text in the document. The following image shows an example of how document Layout detection and extraction works.\n",
